## **Installing the Apache Web Server**

Today I installed the Apache web server.

First, I installed the server using 'sudo' 'apt' 'install' 'apache2'

Then, I installed w3m and elinks which are command line browsers

To install: 'sudo' 'apt' 'install' 'w3m' 'elinks'

To check connection: 'w3m' 127.0.0.1 (or 'localhost')

After that, I accessed the public IP address by selecting the "External IP" from the VM instances page on gcloud. 

'/var/www/html' is the document root. Anything in this file is accessible from the web.

I moved the default page to a different file: 'sudo' 'mv' 'index.html' 'index.original'

Then, using nano, in the index.html file, I practiced using HTML ccode to create a web page.

## Install Wordpress

Today I installed wordpress. It was a fairly straightforward process and went well. 

First, I checked the versions of php and mysql that I had installed. The met the requirements.

```
php --version
```

```
mysql --verson
```

```
cat /etc/issue.net
```

Next, I added PHP modules that allow Wordpress to fuction properly

```
sudo apt install php-curl php-xml php-imagick php-mbstring php-zip php-intl
```

After this, I restarted Apache2 and MySQL

```
sudo systemctl restart apache2
sudo systemctl restart mysql
```

Next, I downloaded and extracted the WordPress software. 

in the /var/www/html/ directory, I downloaded the last WordPress version and extracted it using upzip. I had to install zip first.

```
cd /var/www/html
sudo wget https://wordpress.org/latest.zip
sudo apt install zip
sudo unzip latest.zip
```

Then, I had to create the database and user.

This required switching to the root Linux user and MySQL root user.

```
sudo su
mysql -u root
```

Next, I created the database user and password. I kept wordpress as the username.

```
create user 'wordpress'@'localhost' identified by 'XXXXXXXXX';
create database wordpress;
grant all privileges on wordpress.* to 'wordpress'@'localhost';
```

After this, I changed to the wordpress directory where I copied and renamed the `wp-config-sample.php` file to `wp-config.php`

```
cd /var/www/html/wordpress
sudo cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
sudo nano wp-config.php
```

Then, I found `DB_NAME` and `DB_USER` in the file and changed them both to `wordpress`. Then, I changed `DB_PASSWORD` to the password I created.
At the bottom of the file, I put ` define('FS_METHOD', 'direct');`, which disables FTP uploads to keep the site more secure. 

Next, I changed the URL to `EXTERNAL_IP/library`

```
sudo mv /var/www/html/wordpress /var/www/html/library
```

Then, I changed the file ownership to www-data.

```
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/wordpress
```

Finally, I went to `EXTERNAL_IP/library` and was able to finish up the installation following the prompts. After this, I tried out a few different themes on the site.

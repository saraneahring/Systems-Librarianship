# Log Entry

### Installing and Configuring MySQL

First, I installed the MySQL Comunity Server package

`sudo apt install mysql-server`

Then, logged into the database

`sudo apt mysql -u root`

After that, exited the MySQL `/q` 

Next, I created a regular user account

`sudo mysql -u root`

`create user 'opacuser'@'localhost' identified by 'XXXXXXXX';

### Create a Practice Databaase 

First, I granted all  privileges on the database to opacdb

`create database opacdb default character set utf8mb4 collate utf8mb4_unicode_ci;`
`show databases;`
` grant all privileges on opacdb.* to 'opacuser'@'localhost' with grant option;`

### Logging in as Regular User and Creating Tables

First, I added 

`export MYSQL_PS!="[\d]> "` to `nano .bashrc`

Then, I sourced the file

`source ~/.bashrc`

After that I logged back in to MySQL

`mysql -u opacuser -p`

`-p` instructs MySQL to require the password. You do not see the password when it is being typed.

This is the database we created:

```create table books (
id int unsigned not null auto_increment,
author varchar(150) not null,
title varchar (150) not null, 
copyright year(4) not null,
primary key (ID)
);```

The name of the table is book and the fields created are id, author, title, and copyright year. ID is the primary key. 

To see the created table:

`show tables;`
`describe books`

After that, I practiced adding records. This is an example of adding a record: 
````insert into books (author, title, copyright) values
('Jennifer Egan', 'The Candy House', '2022');```

The records can be viewed with the `select` command

`select * from books;`

Some other commands: 

**Selecting specific fields in the table:**
`select author from books;`

**Selecting books with same author:**
`select title from books where author like '%mbue%';`

**Adding a field:**
`alter table books add publisher varchar(75) after title;`

**Adding information into the newly created field:**
`update books set publisher='Simon \&Shuster' where id='1';`

**Deleting information:**
`delete from books where author= 'Julia Phillips';

**Inserting new information:**
```insert into books
(author, title, publisher, copyright) values
('Emma Donoghue', 'Room', 'Little, Brown \& Company;, '2010'),```

### **Install PHP and MySQL Support**

Then I completed the connnection between PHP and MySQL
First, I installed PHP support for MySQL

`sudo apt install php-mysql php-mysqli

Then restarted Apached and MySQL: 

```sudo systemctl restart apache2
sudo systemctl restart mysql```

Then, I created login.php for PHP to connect to MySQL

```cd /var/www
sudo touch login.php
sudo chmod 640 login.php
sudo chown :www_data login,php
ls -l login.php
sudo nano login.php```

Next, I created a php file

```cd /var/www/html
sudo nano opac.php```

Then, we created added text to the file that was a mix of HTML and PHP

This week we focused on Relational Databases.

First, I crated a new database called DinnerDB and granted it 'opacuser' privileges : `create database DinnerDB;`
`grant all privileges on DinnerDB.* to 'opacuser'@'localhost'`

Then I added a meal table and an ingredient table to the database:

```
create table Meals (
meal_id into auto_increment primary key,
meal_name varchar(100) not null, 
cuisine varchar (50), 
cooking_time int not null default 1 check (cooking_time >0), 
vegetarian boolean
);
```

```create table Ingredients (
ingredient_id int auto_increment primary key,
meal_id int, 
ingredient_name varchar(100) not null, 
quantity varchar(50),
foreign key (mean_id) references Meals(meal_id) on delete cascade
);
```

Then I added data to the tables:

```
insert into Meals (meal_name, cuisine, cooking_time, vegetarian) values
    ('Spaghetti Bolognese', 'Italian', 45, FALSE),
    ('Vegetable Stir Fry', 'Chinese', 20, TRUE),
    ('Chicken Curry', 'Indian', 50, FALSE),
    ('Mushroom Risotto', 'Italian', 35, TRUE);
```

```
insert into Ingredients (meal_id, ingredient_name, quantity) values
    (1, 'Spaghetti', '200g'),
    (1, 'Ground Beef', '250g'),
    (1, 'Tomato Sauce', '1 cup'),
    (2, 'Broccoli', '100g'),
    (2, 'Carrots', '50g'),
    (2, 'Soy Sauce', '2T'),
    (3, 'Chicken Breast', '300g'),
    (3, 'Curry Powder', '2T'),
    (3, 'Coconut Milk', '1 cup'),
    (4, 'Arborio Rice', '1 cup'),
    (4, 'Mushrooms', '1 cup'),
    (4, 'Parmesan Cheese', '1/2 cup');
```

After that I practiced querying the data:

To select everything in the table: 
`select * from Meals;`

To select only vegtarian meals:
`select * from Meals where vegetarian = TRUE;`

To sort by descending and ascending order: 
`select * from Meals order by cooking_time desc;` 
`select * from Meals order by cooking_time asc;` 

To rename tables and use the `join` action to cross-reference table based on `meal_id`
```
select Meals.meal_name as Meals,
    Ingredients.ingredient_name as Ingredients,
    Ingredients.quantity as Quantity
    from Meals
    join Ingredients on Meals.meal_id = Ingredients.meal_id;
```

To list the ingredients and quanities based on name of the meal:
```
select ingredient_name as Ingredients,
    quantity as Quantity
    from Ingredients 
    where meal_id = (select meal_id from Meals where meal_name = 'Chicken Curry');
```

To count meals by cuisine:
```
select ingredient_name as Ingredients,
    quantity as Quantity
    from Ingredients 
    where meal_id = (select meal_id from Meals where meal_name = 'Chicken Curry');
```

To select the meals that take 45 minutes or less to cook:
```
select meal_name, cooking_time 
    from Meals 
    where cooking_time <= 45
    order by cooking_time asc;
```

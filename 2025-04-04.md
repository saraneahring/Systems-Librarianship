### **Creating a Bare Bones Catalog**

Today I set up a bare bones catalog.

Like the setting up the OPAC, this involved creating an HTML and PHP page in nano.

First, I created a cataloging directory
Then, I used nano to create the index.html file

I entered the html text into nano. 
This file creates the form, and activates the PHP search file when the submit button is selected.

After this, I used nano to create the insert.php file. This file allows MySQL to search the ** books** table in the database.
The structure must be the same as the table. 

Next, I had to set up security, so that a username and password was required to enter information in the database. 
to do this, I had to create an authentication file in the **/etc/apache2** directory. 
This is the code used to set the password: 

```
sudo htpasswd -c /etc/apache2/.htpasswd libcat
```

Then I had to communicate to the Apache2 web server that the `htpasswd` would be used to secure the cataloging page. 
This requires opening the apache2.conf file. 
```
sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
```

After this, I had to search for this block of code: 

```
<Directory /var/www/>
  Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
  AllowOverride None
  Require all granted
</Directory>
```
I had to change "None" to "All" 

Next, I went back to the cataloging directory and create the **.htaccess** file using nano. 

I added the following text into the file:

```
AuthType Basic
AuthName "Authorization Required"
AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/.htpasswd
Require valid-user
```

Then I checked the configuration and restarted Apache2. 

The final step was to limit file permissions and ownership from **/var/www/html** to **www-data**

```
 sudo chown :www-data /var/www/html
```

The last step of this process was to enable new files and dirctories created within **/var/www/html** to inherit the group ownership of the parent directory **www-data**.  

```
 sudo chmod -R g+s /var/www/html
```

Then, I was able to go the the exteral IP address and use the form to add books to the catalog.

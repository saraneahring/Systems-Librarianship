## Installing and Configuring PHP

Today I installed and configured PHP

PHP is a serve-side programming language that is primarily used to interact with databases.

First I installed PHP: `sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php`

After that I had to restart Apache: `sudo systemctl restart apache2`

Then I confirmed the installed version of PHP: `php -v` and check the status of Apache `systemctl status apache2`

After that I changed to the document root `cd /var/www/html/

Then I created info.php and removed it.

I changed the default from index.html to index.php:

```cd /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/
sudo cp dir.conf dir.config.bak
sudo nano dir.conf```

I reordered so index.php was first and index.html was second

Then I texted the configuration: `apachectl configtest`

After that I created index.php and added the HTML and PHP code to it. 

I encountered an issue when went to the External IP and it was still showing index.html as the default. I entered index.php to the IP address and it showed the proper PHP information. I'm not sure where things went wrong.

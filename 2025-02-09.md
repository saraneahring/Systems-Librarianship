Today I learn how to manage software using the sudo and apt commands. 

The sudo command is used to "execute a command as another user", by default, the "superuser".
The name of the superuser account is "root"
The root user can perform adminstrative tasks that a reg. user cannot. 
For example, it can add, remove, or update software on a system, modify files or directories outside home directories.

Important commands from this section: 

To locate and install software:

sudo apt update
apt search <package_name>
apt show <package_name>
sudo apt install <package_name>

To remove software and purge related files:

sudo apt --purge remove <package_name>
sudo apt autoremove
sudo apt clean

To keep system up to date:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt autoremove
sudo apt clean

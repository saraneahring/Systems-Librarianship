# Log Entry

**March 26, 2025**

Today I created a bare bones OPAC.

I created a file: **mylibrary.html**

This file created a form used to enter search queries.

Then I created another file: **search.php**

This script is activated by the form created in the previous file. This script creates the connection to the OPAC database. 

Then, I connected to the MySQL server and added a few more books to the database.

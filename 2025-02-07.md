Today I learned about searching with grep. Grep looks for patterns and prints them line by line.

I used the "operating-systems.csv" file to learn how grep can be used to search information within a file.

grep is case sensitive, but the `-i` option can be used to change that.

`-v` can be used to search strings that DO NOT match 

`^` is a regrex that signal the beginning of a line

`$` is a regrex that signals the end of a line

`-c` can be used to count lines

`|` is the infix operater used to search like BOOLEAN OR search

`-w` used to match whole words

`-A` NUM used to select a number of lines to return after the matching line

`-B` NUM used to select a number of lines to return befre the matching line

`-n` used to tell the line number of each hit

`[a-z]{5}` used to search five letter words that include a-z

`[0-9]{4}` used to search four letter numbers


After that I was able to practice using grep with a BibTeX file exported from Scopus.
